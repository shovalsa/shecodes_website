<p class="mainPar">
    <font color="green">she codes;</font> is a community of women in technology, created to achieve an equal number of female
    and male software developers in Israel. Founded in 2013 by Ruth Polachek and a small group of
    volunteers from different tech fields, today <font color="green">she codes;</font> includes approximately 40,000 members.
    Our members include women who want to learn software development or make a career shift into
    high-tech, developers who want to advance their skills and network with other women in high-
    tech and high school students who are learning to program. Our core values are
    Confidence, Persistence, and Community.
    </p>
<p class="mainPar">
    We operate over 20 branches all over Israel. Branches include programming learning tracks, project
    co-working with support from community volunteers, tech lectures, events with Inspirational Women,
    career advising and more. Volunteer opportunities at <font color="green">she codes;</font> contribute to the personal and
    professional development of members. Branches, learning track planning, events, and more are all
    volunteer-run.
